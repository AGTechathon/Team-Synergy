# RescueConnect AI - Backend Fix & Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Fix critical backend issues and enhance the disaster management platform for AGTechathon 2k25. The application is a Next.js-based disaster relief coordination system that needs immediate backend fixes and feature enhancements.

## Current Status
- Frontend: 85% functional with excellent UI/UX
- Backend APIs: 30% functional due to database connection issues
- Third-party integrations: 0% functional (not configured)

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Database Connection & Environment Setup
- Fix missing DATABASE_URL and environment variables
- Establish NeonDB PostgreSQL connection
- Configure JWT authentication secrets
- Set up proper error handling for database operations

### 2. API Endpoints - Core Functionality
- Fix existing broken API routes (/api/requests, /api/alerts)
- Implement missing /api/volunteers endpoint
- Fix authentication flows (user/staff login/signup)
- Ensure proper form data handling and validation

### 3. Third-Party Service Integrations
- Configure Cloudinary for image storage
- Set up Twilio for SMS alerts
- Implement Nodemailer for email notifications
- Add proper error handling for service failures

### 4. Code Quality & Bug Fixes
- Fix syntax errors (userdashboard/page.js line 264)
- Improve error messages and user feedback
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## New Features to Implement

### 1. Enhanced Disaster Management
- Real-time disaster tracking with geolocation
- Automated severity assessment
- Multi-channel alert distribution system
- Emergency contact management

### 2. Volunteer Coordination System
- Volunteer registration and verification
- Skill-based matching for disaster response
- Task assignment and tracking
- Communication channels between volunteers and victims

### 3. Advanced Mapping Features
- Real-time disaster visualization
- Route optimization for emergency response
- Resource location tracking
- Evacuation route planning

### 4. AI-Powered Features
- Intelligent request prioritization
- Automated damage assessment from images
- Predictive analytics for disaster response
- Chatbot for emergency guidance

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
- Users table (victims, volunteers, staff)
- Requests table (emergency requests)
- Disasters table (disaster events)
- Alerts table (notification system)
- Volunteers table (volunteer management)
- Tasks table (volunteer task assignments)

### API Endpoints Required
- POST /api/user/signup, /api/user/login
- POST /api/staff/signup, /api/staff/login
- GET/POST /api/requests (emergency requests)
- GET/POST /api/alerts (alert system)
- GET/POST /api/volunteers (volunteer management)
- GET/POST /api/disasters (disaster tracking)
- POST /api/notifications (multi-channel notifications)

### Environment Variables Needed
- DATABASE_URL (NeonDB connection)
- JWT_SECRET (authentication)
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
- NODEMAILER_EMAIL, NODEMAILER_PASSWORD

## Success Criteria
1. All API endpoints return proper responses (200/201 for success)
2. Database operations work reliably
3. Image upload functionality operational
4. SMS and email notifications functional
5. Real-time mapping displays disasters and requests
6. Volunteer-victim matching system operational
7. All forms submit successfully with proper validation
8. Error handling provides meaningful feedback

## Deployment Requirements
- Environment variables configured
- Database migrations completed
- Third-party services authenticated
- SSL certificates for production
- Load balancing for scalability

## Timeline Priority
1. Critical fixes (database, environment, core APIs) - Immediate
2. Missing API endpoints and authentication - High
3. Third-party integrations - High  
4. New features and enhancements - Medium
5. Advanced AI features - Low

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for database operations
- End-to-end testing for user flows
- Load testing for disaster scenarios
- Manual testing for hackathon demo

This PRD focuses on creating a fully functional disaster management platform ready for hackathon presentation with proper backend infrastructure and enhanced features.
